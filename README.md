# A-basic-NodeJS-website
My first NodeJS website


Hey there !!

This is just a basic NodeJS website I made while learning the basics of NodeJS and NewRelic.

Dependencies:
1. Download latest NodeJS release.
2. Download newrelic package // 'npm install newrelic' in CMD (windows)
3. Sign Up on www.newrelic.com and follow the steps from there.

In case you dont want to monitor the website just follow the following steps:

Step1: Clone the repository.

Step2: Extract the ZIP on your system.

Step3: Delete the 'newrelic.js' file.

Step4: Open 'app.js' in an editor and omit the first line which says "require('newrelic');".

Step3: Run 'app.js' file in your JS environment.

Step4: Go to 'localhost:3000'

Here you go !
